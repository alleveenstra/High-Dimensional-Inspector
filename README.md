HDI is a library for the scalable analysis of large and high-dimensional data.
It contains scalable manifold-learning algorithms, visualizations and visual-analytics frameworks.
HDI is implemented in C++, OpenGL and JavaScript.
It is developed within a joint collaboration between the [Computer Graphics & Visualization](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/) group at the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl) and the [Division of Image Processing (LKEB)](https://www.lumc.nl/org/radiologie/research/LKEB/) at the [Leiden Medical Center](https://www.lumc.nl/).

## Authors
- [Nicola Pezzotti](http://nicola17.github.io/) initiated the HDI project, developed the A-tSNE and HSNE algorithms and implemented most of the visualizations and frameworks.
- [Thomas HÃ¶llt](https://www.thomashollt.com/) ported the library to macOS.

## Used
HDI is used in the following projects:
- [Cytosplore](https://www.cytosplore.org/): interactive system for understanding how the immune system works
- [Brainscope](http://www.brainscope.nl/brainscope): web portal for fast,
interactive visual exploration of the [Allen Atlases](http://www.brain-map.org/) of the adult and developing human brain
transcriptome
- [DeepEyes](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/Publications-new/2018/PHVLEV18/): progressive analytics system for designing deep neural networks
